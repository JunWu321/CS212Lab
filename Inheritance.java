//  Write the Circle class, a subclass of Shape. Use the PI constant from the Math class in your calculations. Test this by adding a circle to the 
// list of shapes in the main method.

  
//    Write two methods in the Circle class called fitsInside, one with a Circle and one with a Rectangle as a parameter. Return true if this 
//   Circle fits inside the other shape without the sides touching. Test this by seeing if your Circle fits in another Circle, a Rectangle, and a Square.

    
//      Write a Solid class with methods to return the volume and surface area with subclasses for Sphere, Cube, and Cone.
